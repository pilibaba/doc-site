## FAQ

  1.What is merchant number? How to get it?

Merchant number（`merchantNO`）, is a number Pilibaba allocated to each merchant. It is used to identify merchant.

[SIGN UP](http://en.pilibaba.com/regist) as a merchant. Then [LOG IN](http://en.pilibaba.com/account/login) to Pilibaba. And you can find the number in [member information page](http://en.pilibaba.com/account/myMemberInfo): 


![](http://api.pilibaba.com/doc/media/14504112333980/14506774532148.jpg)

  2.What is `appSecret`? What is the usage of `appSecret`?
`appSecret` is a secret key Pilibaba allocated to each merchant. It is used to impove the security of transactions.

[SIGN UP](http://en.pilibaba.com/regist) as a merchant. Then [LOG IN](http://en.pilibaba.com/account/login) to Pilibaba. And you can find the appSecret (secret key) in [member information page](http://en.pilibaba.com/account/myMemberInfo): 

![](http://api.pilibaba.com/doc/media/14504112333980/14506779021380.jpg)

  3.Why do you use cent as unit in prices?

To avoid [round-off error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error) in using float numbers, we use integer for all numeric fields. So the unit must be the minimum one. For prices, taxes, shipping fees and order amounts, we all use cent as unit.

For example, supposing the currency type is USD and a product is priced at `1.89` USD, then the `price` field of the product must be assigned to `189` (cent).

  4.How to embed Pilibaba payment?

If your e-store is created via any of the following tools, please view the corresponding guide:

. [Shopify](install-pilipay-in-shopify.md)
. [Magento](pilibaba-kit-for-magento.md)
. [WooCommerce in Wordpress](install-pilipay-for-woocommerce.md)
. [Prestashop](install-pilipay-in-prestashop.md)

Otherwise, a further development must be done. Please contact to your developers, and [contact to Pilibaba](http://en.pilibaba.com/contact).

By the way, for website developers, in order to embed Pilibaba payment, there are mainly two TODOs:

Firstly, in the Admin backend / back office：

Add a configuration page, in which the merchnat could configure merchantNo and appSecret. These two fields are used to identify the merchant and improve security. They need to be saved into a database or a configuration file for future usage;
Add a callback interface. This interface would be assigned to serverUrl field in Submit Order Interface. Please refer to Pay Result Callback Interface, and deal the pay result. Normally, please mark the order's status to be "Paid" when the result is success.
When the order's tracking number is updated, please invoke Update Tracking Number Interface to push the tracking number to Pilibaba. This tracking number will help Pilibaba identify the package.
In the order detail page, please show the barcode image from Barcode Interface . And prompt the merchant like this "You should print the barcode and paste it at a conspicuous area of the package before shipping the package out." This barcode will also help Pilibaba identify the package.
Secondly, in storefront:

Add a "PILIBABA支付" button on the checkout page;
When the "PILIBABA支付" button is clicked, please collect the cart's information, and invoke Submit Order Interface to push the order to Pilibaba.

  5.Are there any environment for testing?

Yes, of course. Our domain for testing payment is `pre.pilibaba.com`. If you want to login as a merchant, please visit `preen.pilibaba.com`.
